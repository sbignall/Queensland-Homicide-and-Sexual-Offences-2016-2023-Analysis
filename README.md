Queensland Homicide and Sexual Offences 2016-2023 Analysis




In this report I take data from reports published betweenthe 2016-2017 financial year and the 2022-2023 financial year by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in Queensland. These data are a count of the charges prosecuted by the government recorded by offence category, and published in 5 administrative regions: Brisbane, Beenleigh, Ipswich, Rockhampton, Marooky, SouthPort, Townsville and Toowoomba. These data are publicly available at https://www.publications.qld.gov.au/dataset/office-of-the-director-of-public-prosecutions-annual-reports.

in this project I use a variety of statistical approaches and visualizations to analyze trends relating to different crime categories, regions and time.
