Queensland Homicide and Sexual Offences 2016-2023 Analysis




In this report I take data from reports published between the 2016-2017 financial year and the 2022-2023 financial year by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in Queensland. These data are a count of the charges prosecuted by the government recorded by offence category, and published in 8 administrative regions; Brisbane, Beenleigh, Ipswich, Rockhampton, Marooky, SouthPort, Townsville and Toowoomba. These data are publicly available at https://www.publications.qld.gov.au/dataset/office-of-the-director-of-public-prosecutions-annual-reports. It is important to emphasize that these data are a breakdown of charges rosecuted rather than a breakdown of convictions or incidents recorded or reported, and I will not be exploring the socio-political factors behind how those numbers would differ and why. Of course as three of these years were during the covid pandemic, unfortunately this may have affected any trends which were occurring. This I will also investigate

With these data, I investigate the trends relating to Homicide and Sexual Offences, using a variety of statistical approaches and visualizations to analyze trends relating to different crime categories, regions and time. I broke this down into 4 main questions: 

1. Is overall crime in these categories increasing across queensland?
2. Is this uniform across all regions?
3. How strongly is this linked to increasing population?
4. Using entirely internal patterns within these data, is this expected to continue to increase?




Question 1: Is overall crime in these two categories increasing in Queensland?

This question is fairly straightforward to answer. As seen in dashboard 1 in clean file, the total incidents in terms of Homicide and Sexual Offences combined has increased from 2016-2017 to 2022-2023. This is also the case for both Homicide and Sexual Offences categories separately. 



Question 2: Is this crime due to population increase only?


In order to calculate this, I calculated the increase over time each year in each category and the population increase from the end of one financial year to the next. I then calculated the pearsons coefficient for the increase of crime every year vs the increase in population every year for every city. In only Toowomba was the correlation high at all. Based on this alone, population increase is not the main driver between the increase in crime. T
